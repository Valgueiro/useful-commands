## Comment to multiple lines once:
I am now using commentary and the <leader>; to comment.

1. CTRL + Q (CRTL+V but on windows) => go to visual block
2. Select lines going to the direction
3. Shift + I (go to insert mode)
4. Add the comment to the line that it is inserting
5. ESC out of it.

it will in the end put the comment chars to all the lines that you selected
